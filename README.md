In this project, 
1 Extract covid data and cities data from JSON 
2 Extract weather data using cities' names and their coordinates from openweathermap api 
3 Perform necessary transformations 
4 Save data as csv file 
P.S: You need to assign your openweathermap api key and your own password in .env file.
